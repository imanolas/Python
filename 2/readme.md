Description:
Write a program that reads a date (eg 2010) and displays the 'True' value if this year is a discrete or the 'False' value if the year is not a discrete. 

The following years are discrete:

From the years of the centuries (eg 1900, 2000, 2100, etc.) discrete are those that are exactly divisible by 400, eg in 2000 it is discrete while in 1900 it is not.
Of the other years, the leap years are those that are exactly divisible by 4, eg in 2004 it is a leap year while in 2010 it is not.
Your password should read the date from the keyboard as a value for the name year. You should also use the name disekto to give the value True or False depending on the results of the algorithm and display this value on the screen.

DEFINITELY use the following names otherwise your password will not be rated:
year to read the date from the keyboard.
disekto to give the value True or False depending on whether the year is discrete or not

SUGGESTIONS 

We assume that the user always enters a value that represents a date and our code does not need to do any additional checking.
FILE SUBMISSION

In the code exercises, the file type that you will upload as a solution should be with a .py extension. No other file format can be accepted as a response.
